                                         Fundamentals of Programming – Personal Project Overview

This repository is a full collection of my coding work for the Fundamentals of Programming course. It includes all weekly labs, homework, and exam exercises — everything I coded during the semester.

# Through these projects, I learned how to:

- Think through problems step by step and turn ideas into working code

- Use conditionals and loops to build program logic

- Write clean, modular code using functions

- Work with arrays, strings, and structures to organize data

- Manage memory using pointers and dynamic allocation

- Solve classic problems with recursion

- Split code into multiple files and use headers like in real-world projects

Every piece of code here helped me move from beginner to writing solid, readable C programs with a better understanding of how computers actually work.
