Fundamentals of Programming

This repository contains my full practical work for the Fundamentals of Programming course. I completed all weekly assignments, homework, and exam exercises using the C programming language.

During this course, I learned how to:

Write clean, functional C code from scratch

Use control structures (if, switch, loops) for logic flow

Work with functions to structure and reuse code

Handle arrays, strings, and structured data using struct

Apply pointers and dynamic memory allocation effectively

Understand recursion and solve classic algorithm problems

Organize projects using multiple files and headers

Through these exercises, I developed practical skills in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, debugging, and memory management.
